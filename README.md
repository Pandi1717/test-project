# test-project
Based on my understanding below is the requirement I am trying to implement. 
I have taken 11 animals as per request to display the basic characteristic of those animals upon request.
I have used inheritance and if/else statements to acheive this requirement. But please note that we can use switch statement(java 8 supports switch with string) to acheive the same.
I didn't use any DB at the moment as I was not requested to do so. DB should be used to store and retrive the details if we further develop the application.
I have used the main method to get data from the user and program responds based on the user data.
Animal is the super class of all other individual animal related classes.
Program displays the characteristic of individual animal at the moment when user enters the animal name. Also at the end, it displays the number of animals can fly,swin,sing and walk.
Inheritance concept is mainly used to design this requirement. 
All the options are tested but couldn't able to add any test result as it is tested via main method.
AnimalCharacteristic.java is the class which contains main method to run this program. So please use this main method to check the result.
